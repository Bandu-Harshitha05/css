        Govardhan is a family man. As a selfless character, he works in a business to provide for his family. He also faces trouble with his drunkard brother. However, he meets Indu when she moves into his "space", which is a room upstairs that Govardhan used. That too, Indu and his family quickly become friends. Soon, they both fall in love. 
        After a big incident, he reconciles with his brother after his mother reveals to Indu that his brother hated him because of Govardhan shaming him. However, when he finds her thesis on his family and him for a college project, he slaps her and vows to teach her a lesson. He goes to Keshu, a previous job offeror, requests to join the company, and asks for a big advance. He uses that advance to defy whatever Indu has written in her thesis. However, it is revealed that Indu is Keshu's daughter. Though annoyed, he continues in the company but demands everything Indu gets. After learning that his flight tickets were not paid for, he resorts to Indu, who provides money for his family. After falling in love again, she hears him talking to a lady negatively about Indu, saying that she is not the right person for him. Heartbroken, Indu isolates herself from him. After revealing that she heard him that day, she leaves him.
